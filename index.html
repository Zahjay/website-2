         <p> What I've learned from this class so far is that coding resembles life in a way, you may encounter a siuation that you fell you can not overcome, but once you're presistent and put in the work you do. The  reason I put a picture of water on the home page is because water flows freely through differnt territories.<br> </p>

             <p> People tend to think of the web as a way to get information or perhaps as a place to carry out ecommerce. But really, the web is about accessing applications. Think of each website as an application, and every single click, every single interaction with that site, is an opportunity to be on the very latest version of that application.<br>Marc Andreessen</p>
